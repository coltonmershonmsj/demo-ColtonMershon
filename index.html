    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img src="IMG_2679.jpeg" alt="A meaningful image to me" width="300">

    <p>
       My name is Colton Mershon, and I am studying criminology and social computing.
        I am interested in how technology can be used to better understand crime and society.

        I chose this image because I love my dog and miss him every day when I am not home.
        This picture reminds me to stay relaxed and remember that home is where my family is.

    <p>
        I chose this font and color because blue is my favorite color and I wanted to keep the website readable.
